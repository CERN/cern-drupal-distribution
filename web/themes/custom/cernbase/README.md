# CERN Base theme   

Provides the basic characteristics of the CERN look & feel.

You can find more details regarding theme in the [official documentation] (https://webtools.web.cern.ch/development/build/styling/cern-theme).

CERN Base theme is used as the *base* of the rest of the themes and as a result
you *should not install it in your website*. The CERN infrastructure takes
care of it for you

### Important Note

The CERN Base theme is used to set some basic variables and values for the CERN 
themes. **Do not copy the theme locally as it will cause issues with future theme
versions**
