# CERN theme   

Provides the basic characteristics of the CERN look & feel.

You can find more details regarding theme in the [official documentation] (https://webtools.web.cern.ch/development/build/styling/cern-theme).

CERN theme contains the main branding elements of CERN.

### Important Note

The CERN  theme is used to set the CERN look & feel. **Do not copy the theme locally as it will cause issues with future theme
versions**.

If for any reason you want to override the CERN Theme, you should consider using
the [CERN Override theme](web-team/cernoverride)
