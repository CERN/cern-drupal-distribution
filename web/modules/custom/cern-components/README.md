# CERN Components

Provides a set of patterns (components) designed for the needs of the CERN users.

You can find more details on the patterns in the [official documentation](https://webtools.web.cern.ch/development/build/styling/cern-patterns).

## Getting Started

This module is placed in the CERN infra so if you own a CERN Drupal website, 
you have this module installed by default. All you have to do is to navigate to 
/admin/modules and enable the module.

If the module for any reason is not placed under the CERN infra, then you can 
manually add it by cloning it or downloading and placing the module under
/modules folder of your website.

### Dependencies

The module has the following dependencies:

* UI patterns: It is used in order to create re-usable patterns
* [Twig tweak](https://www.drupal.org/project/twig_tweak): Drupal module that
provides extra Twig functions.
