# CERN Toolbar

The CERN Toolbar Drupal module provides the CERN toolbar for a Drupal website.

*All CERN Drupal websites are obliged to have this module enabled* so that the
toolbar will be rendered. The toolbar should not be overriden in any way.

## Getting Started

This module is placed in the CERN infra so if you own a CERN Drupal website, you
have this module installed and enabled by default. If for any reason the module
is not enabled, all you have to do is to navigate to /admin/modules and enable 
it.
