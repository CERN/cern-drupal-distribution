# CERN Paragraph Types

Drupal module that provides the CERN Paragraph Types which generate the 
Web Components.

You can find more details on the web components in the [official documentation](https://webtools.web.cern.ch/development/build/expansion-packages/web-components).

## Getting Started

This module is placed in the CERN infra so if you own a CERN Drupal website, 
you have this module installed by default. All you have to do is to navigate to 
/admin/modules and enable the module.

If the module for any reason is not placed under the CERN infra, then you can 
manually add it by cloning it or downloading and placing the module under
/modules folder of your website.
